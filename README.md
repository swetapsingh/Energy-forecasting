# Energy-forecasting
The objective of this study was to apply the complete data science life cycle to a real-world dataset involving household energy consumption. 

tasks included:

Understanding and exploring a time-series dataset.

Cleaning and preprocessing data to make it suitable for analysis.

Creating meaningful visualizations to understand energy usage patterns.

Applying machine learning models for forecasting power consumption.

Drawing insights that could help in optimizing household energy usage.

ABOUT THE DATASET:

The dataset used in this case study is titled household_power_consumption.txt. It contains minute-level electricity consumption data of a household over several years. The attributes include:
Date and Time: Represent the timestamp of each observation.
Global_active_power: Main target variable (in kilowatts).
Global_reactive_power: Reactive power component.
Voltage: Voltage measurements.
Global_intensity: Total current intensity.
Sub_metering_1, 2, 3: Energy usage in different household zones.
